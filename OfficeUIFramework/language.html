        <h1>Declaring Commands and Controls with OfficeUI Markup</h1>
        <p>
        	The OfficeUI framework can be rendered using HTML to declaratively implement the appearance of an OfficeUI application. 
        </p>
        <p>
        	The OfficeUI site has been built up so that it's possible to render fully functional views from any of the following source files:
        	<ul>
        		<li>Extensible Markup Language (XML)</li>
        		<li>JavaScript Object Notation (JSon)</li>
        	</ul>
        	If you don't like any of those formats and you would like to have full control over the rendered HTML, you can always create the HTML yourself.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
        	<strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recommended to either use JSon or XML to render the OffceUI views. 
        	However, it's possible to render it specifying the HTML, the smallest mistake can produce some very strange results which you defintely want to avoid at all the times.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Since every View has it's own specific syntax, view the topic in the View which you want to render.
