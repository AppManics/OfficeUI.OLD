        <h1>Running the package on your local computer</h1>
        <p>
          This section gives additional information on how to run the OfficeUI framework on your local computer.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you've downloaded your package from the server, in the root of the package, you'll find a file named <i>index.html</i><br/>
          You might want to run the file at once, but unfortunately, this won't work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The OfficeUI framework uses Json files in combination with templating files (*.tmpl) to render the complex HTML elements.
          By default, webbrowsers doesn't allow ajax calls (which are used to load the data) on a local filesystem, that's why you need to setup your own environment.
        </p>

        <h2>Setting up a local webserver</h2>

        <p>
          This tutorial will use Microsoft IIS as webserver to setup an environment in which the OfficeUI framework will be able to operate. You're free to choose whatever webserver you like.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> The screenshots in this example are taken from an IIS instance on a Windows 8.1 Pro machine. The interface might be different on other versions.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Create a new website in IIS:</h3>

          <p>Create a new wbsite in IIS with the following parameters:
            <ol>
              <li>Site Name: Choose your desired sitename here.</li>
              <li>Application pool: Free to choose.</li>
              <li>Physical path: Select the root of the OfficeUI framework folder here.</li>
              <li>Host Name: Any hostname you like (for example: www.officeui.com)</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <img src="Resources/Images/IIS/newWebsite.png" />
          </li>

          <li>Defining MIME Types:</li>
          <p>
            Open your created website in Internet Explorer and inside the Features view, navigate to "MIME Types".<br/>
            In here you need to define 2 MIME Types:
            <p>
              <strong>.tmpl</strong>: text/plain<br/>
              <strong>.json</strong>: application/json
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Note:</strong> When you're running the application as a ASP.NET application a web.config is included which sets the MIME-Type already, so in that case, it's not needed to setup the mime types in your webserver.
            </p>
          </p>

          <li>Changing your host file</li>
          <p>
            Open the file <em>C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts</em> if you're running on Windows and add the following line:
            <ol>
              <li>127.0.0.1 www.officeui.com</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> When you're not running Windows, you should add this line to the equivalent file for the Operating System on which you're working.
          </p>
        </ol>

        <p>
        You should now be able to access the website using the url 'http://www.officeui.com'
        </p>
