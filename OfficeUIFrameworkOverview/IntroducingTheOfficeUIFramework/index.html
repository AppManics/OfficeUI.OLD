        <h1>Introducing the OfficeUI Framework</h1>
        <p>
          The OfficeUI Framework is a rich command presentation system that provides a modern alternative to the classic HTML controls of thaditional web applications. 
        </p>
        <h2>Views</h2>
        <p>
          The primary UI components of the OfficeUI Framework (the Ribbon, the Context Menu, the Grid and the Modal) are differentiated structurally through <i>Views</i>.
          The Framework itself support 4 different View. The <a href="#Ribbon">Ribbon</a> view, the <a href="#ContextPopup">ContextPopup</a> view, the <a href="#Grid">Grid</a> View and the <a href="#Modal">Modal</a> view.
        </p>
        
        <h3><a name="Ribbon">The Ribbon View</a></h3>
        <p>
          The UI of the <a href="../../OfficeUIRibbon/index.html">Ribbon</a> if the primary feature of the OfficeUI framework and provides a starting point for ceating next-generation web applications using a very intuitive interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ribbon is a command bar that exposes the features of an application through a series of tabs at the top of a website. It it similar in functionality and appearance to the Microsoft Office 2013 Fluent UI. The ribbon provides an intuitive counterpoint to the trial-and-error process of discovery that is quite common on standard web applications. Optimized for efficiency and discoverability, the ribbon facilitates finding, understanding and using commands with a minimum of mouse clicks and keystrokes through a system of standard controls.

        <h3><a name="ContextPopup">The ContextPopup View</a></h3>
        <p>
          The ContextPopup View provides a rich ContextMenu that can be used in combination with the Ribbon to expose additional commands on the Ribbon, but it can also be used as a stand alone menu somewhere within the website. The ContextPopup view provides additional features such as sub menu items, disabled menu items, icons and seperators.

        <h3><a name="Grid">The Grid View</a></h3>
        <p>
          The Grid view provides a way to display a collection of items in a grid representation. In that Grid, you can select items, execute actions based on a selected row, ...
        </p>
        <p>
          The following image illustrates a Grid implementation in a website.

        <h3><a name="Modal">The Modal View</a></h3>
        <p>
          The Modal view provides a way to draw the user's attention on something important. When the Modal view is opened, it also blocks any input to other elements which are on the page.
