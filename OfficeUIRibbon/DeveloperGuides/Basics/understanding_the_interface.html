        <h1>Understanding the interface</h1>
        <p>
          The Ribbon is splitted in several parts (tabs, groups, action groups and actions). In this guide, you'll learn what those different aspects are and where they come into play.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you take a look at the Ribbon in the first place, you might notice that everything in the Ribbon has it's own dedicated place. The following elements are standard on a ribbon:
          <ul>
            <li>Tabs</li>
            <li>Groups</li>
            <li>Action Groups</li>
            <li>Actions</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2><a name="Tab">Tabs</a></h2>
        <p>
          The tabs on the Ribbon is a way to group different actions into a menu item.<br/>
          In the image below, the tabs are identified by a red border. In this particular case, we have 5 tabs defined (File, Home, Send / Receive, Folder and View).
        </p>

        <p class="note">
          <strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The first tab (File) is colored in blue. This is because this tab is an application tab, but we'll see more about this in Understanding Ribbon Controls
        </p>

        <h2><a name="Group">Groups</a></h2>
        <p>
          Each <a href="#Tab">Tab</a> element can have another separation for the controls that are displayed on the Ribbon. This is called a group. <br/>
          A group can be identified by the seperator (vertical line) which appears on the right side of it, or at the legend that's on the bottom of the group.
          <br/>
          In the image below, the groups are identified by a red border, in this particular case, we have 3 groups (New, Delete and Respond).
        </p>
        <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Ribbon/ribbon_groups.png" alt="Ribbon Groups" />

        <h2>Action groups</h2>
        <p>
          Inside a <a href="#Group">group</a>, we can have different action groups. An icon group is a mechanism that allows us to place some actions in the same area.
          An action group contains a set of actions. All the action groups are displayed horizontally in the Ribbon.
          <br/>
          In the image below, the icon groups are identified by a red border.
        </p>
        <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Ribbon/ribbon_action_groups.png" alt="Ribbon Tabs" />

        <h2>Actions</h2>
        <p>
          An action on the ribbon can represent various controls that allow's the user to execute something on the website.<br/>
          The following actions are supported:

          <ul>
            <li>Small icon (with menu)</li>
            <li>Big icon (with menu)</li>
          </ul>
